# Welcome to Spree Look Book

Spree Look Book enables you to create or edit looks(collection of products) or themes to show a style, or stylist or a clothing line from admin interface. A lookbook can be described as "fashion diaries" because fashion bloggers are constantly updating them on a daily or weekly basis. This gives customers/viewers ideas on how to style outfits, or to show what the latest fashions are. Looks can be created from admin interface by adding a group of different products(For example: A shirt, pants, shoes, and so on..). Those looks can be later put on store in a group(*a.ka. Look Book*).
